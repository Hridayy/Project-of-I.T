    <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
        systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and
        machine visionAI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively
        used in business to automate tasks done by humans, including customer service work, lead generation, fraud
        detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks much better than humans. Particularly
        when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks, such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure
        relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.
        Because of the massive data sets it can process, AI can also give enterprises insights into their operations
        they might not have been aware of. The rapidly expanding population of generative AI tools will be important in
        fields ranging from education and marketing to product design.
        As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services
        use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI
        requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms.
        No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular
        with AI developers.
